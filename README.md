# Virtual Item Recommender System (A Graph Convolution Network Approach)

In this study, we leverage state-of-the-art [Graph Convolution Networks](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn) to perform network embedding of the heterogeneous gaming network comprising of users, games and items. We employ a novel [Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) based loss function - wherein we optimize the node embeddings by trying to minimize the information loss in using the theoretical *Q* distribution (from embeddings) in lieu of the actual gaming network structure ("true" *P* distribution of data).
